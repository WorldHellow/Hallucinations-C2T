According to Wikipedia , the Buffett Rule is a tax plan proposed by President Barack Obama in 2011 to alleviate income inequality in the United States between the top 1percent of Americans and the remaining 99 percent of Americans , due to the disproportionate income growth in the 1 percent- group as compared to the 99 percent- group . The tax plan would apply to individuals earning more than 1 million U.S. dollars per year ; this comprised the top 450,000 of Americans by income when the rule was proposed . The plan is named after American investor Warren Buffett , who publicly stated in early 2011 that he disagreed with the rich paying less in federal taxes , as a portion of income , than the middle class , and has voiced support for increased taxes on the wealthy . It would implement a higher minimum tax rate for taxpayers in the highest income bracket to ensure that they do not pay a lower percentage of income in taxes than less-affluent Americans .

During the early entries in this data , Romania 's borders were very different and much smaller than today , and control of this area often switched hands between the Austrian , Ottoman and Russian empires . The populations during this time are based on estimates made for incomplete census data , and they show that the population grows from 3.6 million in 1844 , doubling to 7.2 million in 1912 , part of this growth is due to a high natural birth rate during this period , but also partly due to the changing of Romania 's borders and annexation of new lands . During this time Romania gained its independence from the Ottoman Empire as a result of the Russo-Turkish War in 1878 , and experienced a period of increased stability and progress . Between 1912 and 1930 the population of Romania grew by over 10 million people . The main reason for this is the huge territories gained by Romania in the aftermath of the First World War . During the war Romania remained neutral for the first two years , after which it joined the allies ; however , it was very quickly defeated and overrun by the Central Powers , and in total it lost over 600 thousand people as a direct result of the war . With the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires after the war , Romania gained almost double it 's territory , which caused the population to soar to 18.1 million in 1930 . The population then decreases by 1941 and again by 1948 , as Romania seceded territory to neighboring countries and lost approximately half a million people during the Second World War . From 1948 onwards the population begins to grow again , reaching it 's peak at 23.5 million people in 1990 . Like many other Eastern European countries , there was very limited freedom of movement from Romania during the Cold War , and communist rule was difficult for the Romanian people . The Romanian Revolution in 1989 ended communist rule in the country , Romania transitioned to a free-market society and movement from the country was allowed . Since then the population has fallen each year as more and more Romanians move abroad in search of work and opportunities . The population is expected to fall to 19.2 million in 2020 , which is over 4 million fewer people than it had in 1990 .

As the H1N1 influenza virus , known as the Spanish Flu , spread across the world and infected between one third and a quarter of the global population , it impacted all areas of society . One such impact was on workers ' wages , as the labor shortage drove up the demand for skilled workers , which then increased wages . In the United States , wages had already increased due to the shortage of workers caused by the war , however the trend increased further in the two or three years after the war , despite the return of so many personnel from overseas . In the first fifteen years of the twentieth century , wages across the shown industries had increased gradually and steadily in line with inflation , with the hourly wage in manufacturing increasing from roughly 15 cents per hour to 21 cents per hour in this period . Between 1915 and 1921 or 1921 however , the hourly rate more than doubled across most of these industries , with the hourly wage in manufacturing increasing from 21 cents per hour in 1915 to 56 cents per hour in 1920 . Although manufacturing wages were the lowest among those shown here , the trend was similar across even the highest paying trades , with hourly wages in the building trade increasing from 57 cents per hour in 1915 to one dollar and eight cents in 1921 . The averages of almost all these trades decreased again in 1922 , before plateauing or increasing at a slower rate throughout the late 1920s . Other factors , such as the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression , make comparing this data with wages in later decades more difficult , but it does give some insight into the economic effects of pandemics in history .

Preferences for watching a new release in a cinema instead of via a streaming service in the United States changed significantly between 2018 and 2020 , signaling a shift in consumer behavior and potentially a risk for movie theaters in the country . Also important to note is the effect of the coronavirus on consumer confidence . There was a drop in the share of movie fans willing to visit cinemas between March and June 2020 , likely the result of consumers fearing the risk of infection and feeling more comfortable viewing movies in the safety of their own home .

The 2020 edition of the index uses data from the year 2018 . The index value for Singapore was determined at 93.63 points . The Netherlands followed with a score of 89.58 points . The beginning of the current era of increasing economic globalization was signaled in by the creation of the Bretton Woods institutions towards the end of the Second World War . These institutions acted as the foundation for the International Monetary Fund , World Bank and World Trade Organization . The institutions , and their modern equivalents , sought to reduce the barriers on international trade in goods , services and capital markets . In the decades following their inception international trade has skyrocketed to become a cornerstone of the international economy , as demonstrated by trends in global export volume of trade in goods from 1950 to 2017 . Countries that are perceived as more economically globalized are those with low tariffs on imports , more free-trade agreements , regulation that accommodates foreign investment and lower non-tariff barriers to trade such as safety regulations on imports . However , economic globalization fails to capture the entire picture in regards to globalization processes and their impact on countries . As such , analysts have placed attention on the social and political effects of globalization as seen in the index for social globalization and index for political organization . To see the combined results of the multiple globalization indexes see the Top 100 countries in the Globalization Index .

This battle began when Union Major General Joseph Hooker moved his armies behind Lee 's position at Fredericksburg , an an attempt to attack him while he was busy facing another Union force . In a surprise move , Lee left roughly 20 percent of his men to defend Fredericksburg , and took the rest of his men to meet Hooker 's armies , removing Hooker 's element of surprise , and the subsequent fighting then forced Hooker back to Chancellorsville where he took up a defensive position . Lee then divided his army again , sending another force , led by Lieutenant General Thomas J . `` Stonewall '' Jackson , to flank one of the Union army corps at Chancellorsville . The risky decision was a success , however Jackson was wounded by friendly fire while on a reconnaissance mission , and died eight days later . The heaviest fighting of the battle ( and second bloodiest day of the American Civil War ) was on May 3 , 1863 , where Lee finally pushed the Union forces out of Chancellorsville , before he was yet again forced to divide his army to face the Union force that had defeated the men Lee had left at Fredericksburg . The decision was another success , and despite the inferior numbers , Lee 's decisions to split his armies at pivotal times took his enemies by surprise , and gave him an overall victory . This victory paved the way for Lee to launch his second invasion of the north in June 1863 , where he would eventually be defeated at the Battle of Gettysburg .

Following a series of unsuccessful uprisings and brief occupations from nearby Serbia and Greece , Albania finally claimed its independence on November 28 , 1912 ; however the Conference of London in 1913 then set the borders of the former-Ottoman states in Southern Europe , which left many ethnic Albanians living in other neighboring states , particularly Serbia ( and what is now Kosovo ) . The newly-formed Albanian state collapsed in the wake of the First World War , and was controlled in parts by Greece , Italy and Serbia . The Paris Conference then established an independent Albanian state , which led to a period of political and economic turmoil that lasted until Italy 's annexation of the region in 1939 , during the Second World War . It is estimated that just under 3 percent of Albania 's population perished as a direct result of the war , as Albania became the main theater for the Axis Powers ' war against Greece . Italy then surrendered control of the area to Germany in 1943 , and after the war ended in 1945 , Albania became a Yugoslav satellite state and remained behind the Iron Curtain until it 's collapse in the 1990s .

In 2019 , the total healthcare expenditure per capita reached a value of approximately 6,120 euro . In the Netherlands , every resident or employee is obliged to take a basic health insurance to cover medical costs from , for example , visits to a general practitioner or the hospital . The Dutch government decides on the cover provided by this package and health insurance companies are obliged to accept everyone who meets the requirements , regardless of age or state of health . An important characteristic of Dutch health insurance , though , is the so-called `` principle of social solidarity '' : the overall costs of health care are paid by everybody . It is since 2008 , for example , compulsory from the age of 18 to pay a total mandatory excess before the basic health insurance reimburses medical costs . In this way , everybody contributes to certain types of healthcare such as maternity care . In 2018 , the total mandatory excess reached a value of 385 euros . In 2005 , the total health expenditure as share of GDP in the Netherlands reached a value of approximately 12 percent . Subsequently , this increased to approximately 17 percent in 2017 . In 2019 , the gross government expenses for primary care reached a value of approximately six billion euros .

However , the population would begin to rise much more rapidly following the country 's independence from the United States in 1946 , as post-war economic aid from the United States and expansive modernization projects by the Philippine government would lead to a significant rise in standards of living and result in a post-war baby boom . This growth would remain steady well into the 21st century , and while the rate of population growth has fallen somewhat in recent years , the population of the Philippines is expected to continue its increase in the coming years , and in 2020 , the Philippines is estimated to have a population of just under 110 million , which is almost twelve times larger than the Philippines ' population in 1920 .
